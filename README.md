## Personal Portfolio Website

## üìù Project Description

This project is a **responsive single-page portfolio website** built using only **HTML and CSS**. The primary objective of this project is to create a clean, professional, and fully responsive web presence for a developer, showcasing their skills, background, and featured projects. The design focuses on simplicity, usability, and accessibility across different devices.

This portfolio site is structured with semantic HTML and styled using modern CSS techniques, including Flexbox, CSS Grid, and responsive design patterns. It contains clearly defined sections such as About, Projects, and Contact, all linked via a sticky navigation bar to provide smooth in-page navigation.

The site is intentionally minimal and performance-optimized, requiring no external frameworks or JavaScript. This makes it ideal for beginners or developers looking to maintain a fast-loading and easily customizable portfolio.

## üéØ Objective

The task was to **design and implement a developer portfolio** as a **single-page responsive website** using only HTML and CSS. The deliverables were:

- A fully responsive layout that adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
- A fixed or sticky navigation menu that scrolls to different sections on the page
- Sections including an introduction, about me, projects, and contact details
- A clean and aesthetically pleasing design using only HTML and CSS
- Structured, maintainable, and semantic code

The website should allow developers to present themselves professionally and highlight their projects in a visually engaging format. Since this portfolio is a static site, it's ideal for hosting on GitHub Pages or any static hosting service.
